a# Problem
# In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.
# 
# The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string sc formed by reversing the symbols of s, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").
# 
# Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.
# 
# Return: The reverse complement sc of s.
